# CONTRIBUTING

General
-
* Completely offline and client-side; no dependencies, servers, websites, or outside connections.
* Keep as much code within javacrypt.html as possible. If there is an instance of code outside of that file, it must be something that is an optional part of the application. If it is something that improves the quality of `javacrypt`, but does not play a role in the actual functionality of the program, put it in the `assets` folder.
* If you could please give your input in some of the `issues`, that would be appreciated.

Commits
-
* By adding commits to this repository, you acknowledge you are responsible for what you post, and all content is subjugated to the license that governs the repository.
* Your content must not bring any harm or disturbance to anything that is or has relation to this application.
* All commit headers should have a description of changes, deletions, or additions that have been made.
* If you are able to, please put all issues, pull requests, and reviews in the appropriate project.

Encryption/Decryption
-
* All rules should be able to be used more than once without the effect being reversed.
* No rule can combine anything.
* This project is inspired by linenoise/asemica, and the encryption process is entirely insired from it. Code accordingly and give the proper credit.
* There cannot be any kind of randomization, because on the decryption side how will the user be able to get the correct result?
