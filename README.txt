## asemicrypt
An easy way to encrypt and decrypt text offline.

How to Use
-
Launch `install.sh` to download necessary packages.
Execute `run.py` to start the program.
You will then be guided in choosing whether to encrypt or decrypt, the format of your message, and a PIN to protect it.
Messages will go into `output.txt`.

Additional Information
-
If something went wrong, see `errorlog.txt`.
You can change swap `corpus.txt` with another file of your liking, but it has to have the same title.
If needed, disconnect Wi-Fi and have pre-made `.txt` files to paste your code, preventing keylogging.
The stylesheet, `style.css`, is not required, and can be removed.
