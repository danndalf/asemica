## javacrypt
An easy way to encrypt and decrypt text offline.

How to Use
-
Before you get started, you will need the most recently updated versions of Python and Perl (programming languages) and your browser.
The first thing to do is click on `run.py`, and it will open up `home.html`.
From there, you will be guided in choosing the format of your message, what your message is, and a PIN to protect it.
Then the scripts shall do their thing, and you will find your encrypted/decrypted messages in `output.txt`

Additional Information
-
Files in the `texts` folder come with a timestamp.

There is a Python program located in the assets folder (`prepareCorpus.py`) that can format a corpus file for you, but it connects to the web to run its service.

Do not use the upload feature unless you have all other tabs closed on your browser or unless you have to.
These browsers have their security settings put into place for your sake.

Disconnect Wi-Fi and have pre-made .txt files to paste your code, preventing keylogging.

You can always save the code as a .txt file and compress it into a .zip file (or other kind).
Once you have to use it again, save the program as the file type it was before.
Along with this, you can turn the `.css` and `.js` files into `.min.css` and `.min.js` files.
Or you could also embed everything in `javacrypt.html` altogether!
