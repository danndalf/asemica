## asemicrypt
An easy way to encrypt and decrypt text offline.

How to Use
-
To start, you need to execute `run.py`, and it will open up `home.html`.
From there, you will be guided in choosing the format of your message, what your message is, and a PIN to protect it.
Then the scripts shall do their thing, and you will see that your messages are in `output.txt`.

Additional Information
-
If there are any problems that occur in the process, find what went wrong in `errorlog.txt`.
You can change swap `corpus.txt` with another file of your liking, but it has to have the same title.
If needed, disconnect Wi-Fi and have pre-made `.txt` files to paste your code, preventing keylogging.
The stylesheet, `style.css`, is not required, and it can be removed if desired.
